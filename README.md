# New Years Resolutions

A React app that helps keep track of, and stay on top of, your resolutions this year.

## TODO

- Set up Facebook and Twitter meta tags. Potentially create a way to screenshot the page someone is trying to share and sue that as the preview?

## Ideas

- Fireworks in the background
- Edit resolutions
- Add time intervals that will send you a checking-in email every interval (monthly, weekly, etc.)
